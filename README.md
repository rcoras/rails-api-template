# Fishing Tracker Rails Api

I enjoy fishing and also enjoy diving into data and finding patterns and looking back at past performace. I decided to build an app where users can track their fishing stats and look back on them as I know it's something I would use. To start I created an ERD showing the table I will have and how it will link to users. Once I set with a minimum product idea I built out the API to track trip info like location, lenght of trip, fish caught etc. and tied this table to user via a user id. As I improve my fishing tracker I'd like to create another table that stores information on which fish were caught.

A link to the repo is here:

And the deployed api url is: https://sleepy-reef-72451.herokuapp.com

You can see my original ERD diagrams here:

Technology used to build this api:
* Ruby
* Rails
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Ajax

I also built out the client side to this application where a user can log in, add and see their stats. This can be seen here: https://rcoras.github.io/fishing_log_client/
And the repo for the front end is here: https://github.com/rcoras/fishing_log_client
